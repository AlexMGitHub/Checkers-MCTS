# Purpose:      Contains classes to implement the Monte Carlo Tree Search  
#               algorithm for two-player turn-based games.
#
# Classes:
# 1. MCTS       -- Class to implement the MCTS algorithm and interact with the
#                  game environment.
# 2. MCTS_Node  -- A class representing a MCTS node.   
#
# Notes:
# 1. Terminology based on "A Survey of Monte Carlo Tree Search Methods" by
